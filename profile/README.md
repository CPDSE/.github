## 🚀 About

CPDSE is a joint initiative between the **University of Copenhagen** and the **University of Southern Denmark**.  
We integrate modern data science into pharmaceutical education and research – and educate the next generation of  
“data and drug bilinguals”.

We aim to:

- 📊 Build a coherent center community around the new frontier field of pharmaceutical data science.
- 📖 Upgrade existing courses, design new courses, develop course material and train teachers.
- 🎓 Contribute to teaching at bachelor, master, PhD and life-long learning levels.
- 👥 Establish national and international collaboration and networks and attract talented students and researchers.

## 📍 Resources

This GitHub organization hosts resources that support pharmaceutical data science education and collaboration, including:

- **Teaching materials** – examples, templates, and code to support modern data science teaching in pharma  
- **Open educational resources** – external notebooks, exercises, and demo projects  

We are continuously growing this organization with resources for pharmaceutical data science.  
Stay tuned as we add new repositories, teaching modules, and example projects.
